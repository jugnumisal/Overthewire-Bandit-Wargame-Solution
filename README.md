This is a repository for the solution to all the levels of [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame.

# Guide on how to use the repository

Separate readme files for each level solution is added to this repository with a walk through on how to use the linux commands to retreive the password to next level.

# Notes:
* Please note that this is a guide on how to crack each level and should not be used as a tool to simply get the password to next level.
* I highly recommend trying to retreive the password on your own and then read the solution guide here if you are struck really bad.
