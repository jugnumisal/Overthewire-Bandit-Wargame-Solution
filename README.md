This is a repository that shows how I attempted all the levels of [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)'s: [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame.

This repository shall be treated as guide on how to crack each level and should not be used as a tool to simply get the password to next level.

I highly recommend trying to retreive the password on your own first, then read the solution guide here if you are stuck real bad.

# Guide on how to use the repository

* Separate readme files for each level solution is added to this repository with a walk through on how to use the linux commands to retreive the password to next level.

* Please note that this repo is still under build stage. I am working on creating the write-ups for all the levels. 

* Start from [Level0](https://github.com/jugnumisal/Overthewire-Bandit-Wargame-Solution/blob/master/Level0.md)
